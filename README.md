# <p align="center">Tales of the Underworld - What if up wasn‚Äôt up?</p>

<b>A minimalist 2D physics-based platformer</b> built around puzzle-solving and a short narrative. You play in a world of black, white, and gray ‚Äî a visual style that keeps essentials clear while keeping the vibe. Use the <b>*Quantum Cloak*</b> to phase through select walls and the <b>*Gravi-Boots*</b> to flip gravity on command. 

Navigate through logic-driven levels using moving platforms, buttons, doors, and interactive boxes that respond to both physics and gravity. A checkpoint-based save/load system supports thoughtful exploration, while optional coins and collectibles offer a challenge for completionists. Every level is a puzzle ‚Äî every mechanic is a key.

## üïπÔ∏è Core Mechanics

- <b>Gravity Shifting:</b> Use special gear like the Gravi-Boots to flip gravity and walk on ceilings. Every level becomes a two-sided puzzle.

- <b>Phase-Walking:</b> A mysterious Quantum Clock lets the player pass through specific walls ‚Äî but only under certain conditions.

- <b>Physics-Based Interactions:</b> Moveable boxes react to gravity changes and momentum. Use them to trigger pressure plates, block hazards, or reach high places.

- <b>Custom Jump Variants:</b> From short hops to gravity-altered launches ‚Äî movement evolves with each power-up.

- <b>Checkpoint System:</b> Automatic and manual saves at terminals let you retry tricky sections without losing progress.

## üß© Puzzle Elements

- <b>Pressure Plates & Doors:</b> Some doors require clever use of boxes or environmental objects to open.

- <b>Moving Platforms:</b> Time your shifts and jumps ‚Äî some platforms obey gravity too.

- <b>Collectibles:</b> Hidden coins and hard-to-reach extras add replay value and challenge.

- <b>Layered World Design:</b> Visual clarity through grayscale ‚Äî interactive objects are always readable, while decoration stays subtle.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Engine Features & Visuals

- <b>Powered by Godot Engine 4:</b> Developed using Godot‚Äôs Vulkan renderer for smooth, stylized 2D visuals and efficient performance.

- <b>Custom Shader Effects:</b> Uses CanvasItem shaders to control contrast, brightness, vignette, and post-process color inversion ‚Äî all rendered through a unified ColorRect layer.

- <b>Responsive Design:</b> Fast input handling and pixel-perfect collisions help maintain consistent, fluid platforming.

## ‚ôø Accessibility & Settings

- <b>Brightness & Contrast:</b> Fully adjustable to fit your screen and visual preferences.

- <b>Bloom Toggle:</b> Optional bloom effect to add soft highlights, easily disabled for clarity.

- <b>Invert Colors Option:</b> Color inversion effects can be turned off entirely for accessibility and visual comfort.

- <b>Minimalist Aesthetic:</b> Clear black, white, and gray visuals ensure accessibility without losing atmosphere.
